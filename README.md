A sample Angular 2 site, complementing the online article

# Basics
Clone or download this Angular 2 site to your computer. Use `npm install` in the main project folder to generate the _node_modules_ folder.

# Notes/Errata
The site was generated using minimum Angular 2 / TypeScript dependences of version 2.0. Please do not attempt to get this site to run using older versions of either.

Thank you for taking the time to look at the code. The code is a mockup for a product site, so functionality is minimal.
