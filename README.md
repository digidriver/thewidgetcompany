# The Widget Company Mockup (non-CLI version)
A sample Angular 2 site, complementing the online article

# Basics
Clone or download this Angular 2 site to your computer. Use `npm install` in the main/root project folder to generate the _node_modules_ folder.

This version of the site was not generated via Angular CLI. Testing frameworks and other project addons will need to be added to this project (if possible).

# Notes/Errata
The site was generated using minimum Angular 2 / TypeScript dependences of version 2.0. Please do not attempt to run this site using older versions of either.

Thank you for taking the time to look at the code. The code is a mockup for a product site, functionality is minimal.
